    <h1>Impacts of Climate Change</h1>
    <h2>Rising Sea Levels</h2>
    <p1>
        Average air temperatures in the region have increased by about 5°C over the last 100 years. 
        The Antarctic ice sheet is the largest single mass of ice on earth, accounting 
        for around 90% of all fresh water on the earth's surface and spanning almost 14 million sq km. 
        If they were to all melt, water levels would rise dramatically, covering at least 40% of the known land available

    </p1>
    <h2>Deforestation</h2>
    <p1>
        Sub-Arctic boreal forests are likely to be particularly badly affected, 
        with tree lines gradually retreating north as temperatures rise. 
        In tropical forests such as the Amazon, where there’s abundant biodiversity, 
        even modest levels of climate change can cause high levels of extinction.
